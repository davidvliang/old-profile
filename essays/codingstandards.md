It would likely be an inconvenience and annoyance for the reader. This is why text is meant to be structured in a manner that is easily deciphered by others. The purpose of writing text is to convey a message to an audience, so it would not make sense to have that message shrouded in a fog of bad formatting and poor style. In the same sense that properly formatting text is imperative to creating a clear passage that an audience can read and understand, properly formatting code is important for producing content that a fellow programmer can read and understand.

After one week of using ESLint to achieve proper coding style, my experience was frustrating yet rewarding.  I would describe it as putting braces on your teeth. Initially it feels limiting, constricted and incredibly painful, but eventually, it becomes bearable and your teeth are all straight and nice. That is to say, ESLint really went after the way I formatted my code and did my spacings. After correcting my format according to its specifications, I found my code looking completely clean and comprehensible. However, similar to braces, it isnâ€™t something that I would always want on me for all eternity. Linting is a great tool for keeping up to coding standards, but I feel that it is something I feel should be learned from and not relied upon.
