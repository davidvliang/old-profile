## Introduction

The field of computer engineering is constantly growing and evolving to keep up with the times. Over time we witness the emergence of newer, more widespread technologies that are updated, innovated, or replaced year after year. As a result, engineers must adapt to learn these new technologies. We as a society utilize computer technologies for entertainment, productivity, development, education. We are able to solve problems that were once deemed impossible, but society’s list of problems never ceases. The purpose of this report is to explore the issues that society faces and the impacts of computer engineering. 

## Global Economy

There are many ways in which the economy had flourished due to significant advancements made in the computer engineering industry. A dominant example is the upbringing of the Internet. The world wide web has an empowering influence over not only the large industries and national economies but also millions of individual people around the globe. This allows for instant communication, computation, and has reportedly contributed to 21% of Gross-Domestic Product (GDP) growth in mature economies throughout the past five years [1]. The GDP represents the dollar value of combined goods and services over a specified time period. This number is one of the primary indicators used to gauge the health of an economy and is often used to denote the size of an economy [2]. However, in the case of rebuttal, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) provides a benchmark of the state of the economy and had reported that it is becoming exceedingly difficult to measure the size of the up and coming digital economy that exists over the internet [3]. They go on to describe how statisticians are playing a poor game of catch up to the new technologies that have diffused in the work environment. We realize that the Internet is a great benefactor that improves the GDP economic game, but we have yet to fully reap the benefits without consequences. Other examples of engineering solutions that have contributed toward the greater global economy include efficient online money transfer and cryptocurrency.

Reversely, there are several ways that the global economy has affected the computer engineering solutions. Computer engineering is a profession that is constantly shaped by consumer demand. That is to say that the consumers decide which problems need solving and which products should be created and sold. The global economy ultimately models this consumer demand, thus greatly impacts the field of computer engineering. For instance, as this global economy rises, the computer engineering job market goes up, more depends on technologies demand more employees equipped with such a skillset. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that [4]. Other instances of the global economy’s effect on computer engineering solutions include the role of consumerism in determining the direction of production and design as well as the decrease in the cost of electronic components. 

As newer technologies are being brought forward into the playing field, we expect to see great innovations to how we pursue productivity. Examples of up and coming computer engineering innovations that may serve toward improving our global economy include artificial intelligence.

## Societal Impact

<img class="ui small right floated spaced image" src="../images/essays/mcdonalds.jpg">

We can continue the discussion of engineering technologies by focusing on its relevance in modern society. Computer systems are becoming increasingly commonplace. Restaurants have adapted to let their waiters use touchscreen tablets to take orders, replacing the conventional paper and pen. Some places have implemented self-service systems in which the customer orders their food through a tablet placed on their table [6]. McDonalds restaurants are incorporating electronic kiosks that speed up the ordering process and eliminates the need for human interaction. The only downside is that the screens have been reportedly traced with fecal matter. At Chili’s restaurants, customers may choose to order from the tablet screen on their table. This can also be used to play games and call a waiter. The tablet can also be used for payment with credit card and printing receipts. This continues to redefine society’s standards of customer service. The booming popularity of social media, smartphones, video games, and consumer electronics make technology commonplace in modern society. We can only expect this trend to increase and more technology to be integrated in society as further innovations are made. 

## Environmental Impact

Though it is not a direct correlation, computer technologies have both positive and negative impacts on the environment. We first focus on its negative impacts. Earlier we discussed the commonality of technology and its abundance due to consumerism. Our technological devices are constantly being upgraded, so we toss out the outdated technology. The waste that accumulates from electronic waste is incredibly harmful to the environment. These electronics contain non-biodegradable materials, heavy metals, and toxic materials that will leak into the ground and contaminate the earth [7]. Our continuing disposal of electronics poses a great threat to our environment as more technologies are being developed and more technologies become obsolete.  

On the contrary, the implementation of technological systems also serves towards sustainability. Earlier we had discussed replacing paper and pen with electronic tablets at dining facilities. These “replacements” occur in many other situations as well. For instance, in the classroom, smartboards replace regular chalk and whiteboards to allow for less waste from dried up markers and chalk dust. The era of digital notetaking is upon us, where students use tablets and styluses to take notes as opposed to traditional notebooks. These alternative methods are seen more as “tech savvy” than “environmentally conscious, but the latter still holds true.

## Contemporary Ethical Issues

The ethical issues that concern the world of computer engineering include, but is not limited to, the discussion on cybercrime and security. Earlier we have described the internet as a great invention that we utilize to exchange information for the sake of entertainment, productivity, and sale of efficiency. However, behind this very veil of information exchange lurks perpetual threats include malware, phishing, denial of service, and much more. Malware refers to any kind of malicious software that is designed to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network [8]. They can render any computer or network inoperable. Phishing is a more human-targeted approach in which a criminal would send malware disguised as important or interesting emails. These emails then prompt the victim to enter sensitive information such as bank account information or credit card information. A denial of service attack is a brute force method of preventing an online service from working properly. An example would be sending loads of traffic to the website to overwhelm the server and database. These attackers may use hundreds of computers to generate traffic, which is called a distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS for short. 

These malicious activities can target anyone and anything, from a single student to an entire corporation. In July of 2018, the video game company, Blizzard Entertainment, was hit with a DDoS attack. Game servers were pushed offline, and players were unable to log in or play games for almost three days. The company was in effect held ransom and the perpetrators behind the attack made demands to have their messages retweeted at least 2000 times. After this condition was satisfied, Blizzard reportedly gained back control of their servers. Similar attacks in the latter half of 2018 affected the company Ubisoft and even the Swedish Social Democratic Party [9]. It is evident that the dangers of the internet are commonplace. Action must be taken to hold off these crimes because, unfortunately we see as technology evolves crime would always linger with it.  

## Contemporary Technical Issues

Regarding technical concerns with computer engineering solutions, I’d like to discuss the topic of artificial intelligence. Today in technology, there are many issues that we are limited by and other issues that we have yet to solve. The concept of artificial intelligence has become a hot word in current society. AI is a wonderful tool that can be used to do remedial tasks in our everyday lives. The great debate over AI is whether it would take jobs away.  This topic is very quickly refuted by the fact that it will also create new jobs and change the way that everyone works today.  The analogy that is used is the transition from “horses to automobiles” is the same as the transition from our current jobs to jobs with A.I.  Many of these topics are interesting and important, however my future plans are not as specific that they would get tarnished or altered because of these changes.  Rather I find myself being more and more excited by the fact that I will be able to study topics that I could only dream about as a child.

Another technical issue is that of net neutrality. This concept is defined as a set of rules that internet service providers, or ISPs, must follow in order to ensure equal opportunity for all websites. This means that ISPs will be unallowed to block or slow the connection to any websites at all.  On December 14, 2017 net neutrality was repealed which allowed ISPs to basically do whatever they felt like doing.  This is very important because now ISPs can charge extra for access to specific websites as they feel, and this can seriously impact the development of other web servers and websites.  Coding in schools is a topic being discussed because the president of the united states recently passed a bill that would fund the Department of Education to further invest into computer science programs and classes as well as other math-science programs.  This is important because we can see that the USA is wanting to increase the number of students who have a computer science background and possibly increase the number of computer science/engineers that the USA will produce.  

## Current Events/Issues and Computer Engineering Problems

Current events shape industries, specifically in the computer industry. Recently SpaceX has launched their most powerful rocket into orbit, providing the opportunity to lift off heavier payloads into space, potentially giving rise to computer technology for space exploration in all things related to space vehicles, suits, and even technology to use on the surface of Mars as SpaceX makes their venture there. This gives opportunities to engineers, and future engineers like myself, to work on space technology as there will be a demand for this if SpaceX continues to move forward.

Another current issue that could shape the computer engineering profession could be the increasing effects of global warming. These effects could push governments and new companies to fund projects into renewable energy, such as smarter control systems for solar panels or wind turbines to face the source of the most energy.  This issue could push forward a whole new era of renewable energy and perhaps technologies like solar panels integrated into consumer electronics as well as many large-scale projects, such as solar roofs that are now being developed.

Lastly, the end of net neutrality at the end of 2017 could give way to some changes in consumer electronics. With no net neutrality, the internet may start veering in a less open-market type of operation with lots of freedom for consumers, but it may sway in the direction of heavy handed corporate structuring where there are less options and corporations will have more say in what content pushes through. This will affect the computer engineering industry because corporations will likely push out more consumer electronics dedicated to their services, while there will be less experimentation on the consumer end. This means more jobs for computer engineers as they need people to design these consumer electronics.

## Conclusions

We discussed the impacts that engineering has on many different topics from economics to underdeveloped countries and the environment. These issues all shape the direction of engineering because without consumer support, engineers have no one to buy their innovations and so the current interests is where engineers will focus on in the future. These issues also shine a light on past mistakes that all future engineers can learn from, where all impacts should be assessed, such as economic and environmental.
