Coming from a C/C++ background, JavaScript was not too difficult to pick up due to similarities in the syntax. The key differences I noticed include not having to specify a variable type (i.e. int, float, char, array). Instead, JavaScript can determine automatically what datatype is being used and adjusts accordingly. Also, I feel that this language is much more forgiving. It is easier to get away with sloppy code or missing semicolons because the compiler would accommodate for these omissions.
