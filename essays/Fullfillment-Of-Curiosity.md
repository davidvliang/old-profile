  When I was a kid I did not play computers all that much. My favorite things to do were playing with legos and assisting my dad with home and auto repairs. I became fascinated by how you can use measly Lego blocks to create something really cool. I would then look at the world around me and wonder just what types of Legos were used to create these cars, televisions, computers, and cell phones. My curiosity of how technologies work has driven me to focus my studies in the field of engineering. 

As I grew older, technology grew with me. In recent years we as a society bared witness to computers found in cars, refrigerators, and in every personâ€™s pocket. Our dependence on computers will only continue to increase. It was then I had decided to change from hardware to software focus. With a degree in Computer Engineering, I seek to learn more about the Internet of Things, Cyber Security, and Machine Learning.
