The dividing line between technology and consumers wears ever thin. We "can" use machine learning for image recognition and artificial intelligence for self driving cars. However, seldom do we stop and think, "should we?" The ACM code of ethics was created to make developers think twice before creating. They must question whether the software they are creating is morally sound. The software must serve to benefit society and not impose harm. It must be honest and trustworthy while not imposing discrimination. This and much more is spricified in the code of ethics. 

Let us discuss the Cambridge Analytica Facebook Scandal of 2018. It was reported that Camnrdige Analytiva collected had gathered the personal data of millions of unaware Facebook users and used it to push a political agenda. This incited discussion on ethical standards on social media corporations. The scandal had shed a public eye of how their data is used across social media platforms. It violated the ACM code of ethics by betraying trustworthiness and user privacy while potentially causing harm millions of users. 

I believe that all developers should adhere to the ACM code of ethics because it supports the well-being of users and clients. Ethics in software development has real world implications and should be a prioritized to make quality, safe content that everyone can benefit from.
