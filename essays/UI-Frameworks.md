I had gotten my first ever taste of UI design last week with an introduction to HTML and CSS. Learning front end programming was great and I felt I was completely ready to make the awesome webpages I wanted.  However, I don’t plan to create web pages that belonged back in the dark ages of the internet. This week I was introduced to the concept of UI Frameworks and my mind had just been blown to smithereens. UI Frameworks offers a compilation of standardized code that allows for more advanced customization of design. 

This week I had learned a framework called Semantic UI, which boasts a flat and modern design scheme. This specific framework came chock-full of the tools needed to format content in a simple and efficient manner. There were like many standardized segments like menus, grids, and buttons that I found was very simple to implement. Also, the ability to change and customize these sections with simple keywords like “fitted” or “mini” that are a straightforward approach to advanced customization. To make a facebook icon that is also large and with an inverted color, I can use input the class="large inverted facebook icon" to do the job. Simple methods for great customization. I believe UI frameworks like Semantic UI are are great to have in any software developers toolbelt. The ability to easily create aesthetically appealing web pages to the extent of the developers imagination. The sky's the limit with UI frameworks.
