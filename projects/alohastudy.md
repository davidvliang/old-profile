For my Software Engineering I course, I worked in a team of three to design a website that would help students at our University find and rate great places to study in and around our campus. Students can create an account on this website and then view a list of spots. This list can be filtered, and a search bar allows students to find specific spots. Users can also add their own spots to the website, but it will not be displayed until the admin verifies this spot through the Admin List, which is a protected route only visible to the administrator of the site. 

I came into this project as a novice at web design and have since gained experience in both front-end and back-end development. Each member of our team completed issues and made commits to the project. The features that I worked on include the comments and rating feature that allows users to rate and give their feedback on certain study spots. I also took part in developing the Users List which allows the administrator to view every user registered on the site and quickly access their profile pages. Although this project was done as an assignment for a class, it was quite enjoyable to work on and I have the ambition to make further commits in the future.
